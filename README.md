Dexcam - An hourly tweeting photo app for Raspberry Pi

# Dexcam

You will need:

1. A Raspberry Pi
2. Rasperry Pi camera
3. Ideally a wireless power and internet source hooked up to the Pi.

Setup instructions:

1. Setup Tweepy: https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy

2. Copy the Dexycam code and make your own access and secret tokens. Fill them in in the correct boxes on the script.

3. You can run the script by typing ./dexcam.py from within the containing folder. But I recommend setting it up on a cron.
